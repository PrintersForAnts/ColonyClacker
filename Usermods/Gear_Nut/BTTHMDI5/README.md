Took the work that @BlindBadger started and modified it for the CC mod from the amazing Jadecky

I have included the stl for the bezel and screen though I made no changes to those from BlindBadgers work. 

The mount and bezels will fit perfectly with the rest of the CC skirt parts 

It has been printed and tested all parts are oriented for printing and have the nessicary supports in place where needed and should break away clean 

If anything needs fixed feel free to let me know and I will get to it as soon as I can :) 

one thing to note. Depnding on the HDMI cable you use you MIGHT have to trim back the A accent though that will be completely hidden under the mount and even with as far back as I needed to trim mine to use the inclided HDMI cable it does not interfere with any of the mounting holes.
