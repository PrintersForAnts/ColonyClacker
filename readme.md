## üö™ What is Colony Clacker?

Inspired by the popular [Clicky-Clack Fridge Door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door) mod by tanaes, **Colony Clacker** is specially designed for Printers for Ants (PFA), and other 1515 based printers.

Completely remodeled from scratch (not just scaled), it boasts enhanced stealthy aesthetics, improved tolerances, and optimized STLs for top quality printing using standard Voron settings.

## Print Recommendations

**All STLs are oriented for printing.**

- **Material:** ABS or ASA
- **Layer height:** 0.20 mm (including first layer)
- **Wall count:** 4
- **Extrusion width:** 0.40 mm (forced)
- **Top/bottom solid layers:** 5
- **Infill:** 40% (Grid, Gyroid, Honeycomb, Triangle, or Cubic)
- **Supports:** Not required

---

### Latch Variants

Provided in multiple offsets to suit different panel/foam thicknesses. The required frame‚Äëto‚Äëdoor distance is embossed on the back of each STL (e.g., **6** = **6 mm**).

### Handle_C Logo Variants

Handle_C versions are available with logos from various brands and printers, allowing you to customise your build.

## üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Instructions
Assembly is intuitive. Use the provided images for visual guidance if you encounter difficulties.

**Important:**
- Superglue magnets securely into the latch and corresponding handle piece
- Hardware locations can be seen in the assembly images below.
- On initial build, you may experience less clacking, this is usually due to the foam needing to settle, or the 2x screws in the latch being too tight.
