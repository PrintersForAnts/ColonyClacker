## 🚪 What is Colony Clacker?

Inspired by the popular [Clicky-Clack Fridge Door](https://github.com/tanaes/whopping_Voron_mods/tree/main/clickyclacky_door) mod by tanaes, **Colony Clacker** is specially designed for Printers for Ants (PFA), and other 1515 based printers.

Completely remodeled from scratch (not just scaled), it boasts enhanced stealth aesthetics, improved tolerances, and optimized STLs for easy printing using standard Voron settings.

## Print Recommendations

**All STLs should be correctly oriented for printing.**

- **Material**: ABS or ASA
- **Infill**: 40% (Grid, Gyroid, Honeycomb, Triangle or Cubic)
- **Supports**: Not required
- **Layer Height**: 0.2mm (Including first layer)
- **Wall Count**: 4
- **Extrusion Width**: Forced 0.4mm
- **Solid Top/Bottom Layers**: 5

- Optional latch variant (`Larger Surface Area Latch`) is included for improved print reliability.

## 🛠️ Assembly Instructions
Assembly is intuitive. Use the provided images for visual guidance if you encounter difficulties.

**Important:**
- Superglue magnets securely into the latch and corresponding handle piece.
- Follow the detailed hardware orientation in assembly images.
- On initial build, you may experience less clacking, this is usually due to the foam neededing to settle, or the 2x screws in the latch being too tight.
